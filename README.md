## React-based blogging client

## Notes:
Christmas Day Note: It's Christmas Day. I took today off.

Currently only generating static content while I experiment and build out the
react components and design that I want to move forward with.

Once I figure out how things will look, and the granularity of my components
I will move forward with tests and dynamic behavior.

- run webpack
- run grunt
- run webpack-dev-server
