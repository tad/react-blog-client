## React-based blogging client

## Notes:
Currently only generating static content while I experiment and build out the
react components and design that I want to move forward with.

Once I figure out how things will look, and the granularity of my components
I will move forward with tests and dynamic behavior.

## Instructions
- run npm install
- run webpack
- run grunt
- run webpack-dev-server
- visit http://localhost:8080 in your browser

## TODO:

Add something to simulate external loading of content.

## Coded using
- ES6
- React
- Redux

## Testing
- Mocha
- Chai

## Backend
Will connect to my node-blog-server project.
